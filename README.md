Eukaryotic translation initiation requires the recruitment of the large,
multiprotein eIF3 complex to the 40S ribosomal subunit. Using X-ray structures
of all major components of the minimal, six-subunit
_Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ eIF3 core, together with cross-linking
coupled to mass spectrometry, we were able to use
[IMP](http://integrativemodeling.org) to position and orient all eIF3
components on the 40S•eIF1 complex, revealing an extended, modular
arrangement of eIF3 subunits.
